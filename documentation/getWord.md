## Project Documentation - getWord.js

**Purpose**
The purpose of the getWord endpoint is to serve a random word to the front end game. This endpoint is called when the game is first launched to retireve the inital word and again when the player wishes to play another game using a different seed/date value. This endpoint is critical to the operation of our web component. 

**Data Requirements**
To correctly function, this endpoint requires a seed value to determine the date. Since each day has a different "word of the day" assigned to it, this seed value allows the endpoint to know which word to return. The seed value should be sent to the endpoint as a date value in the MM/DD/YYYY format. For example: `/api/getWord?myDay=03/21/2022`

**What does this endpoint return?**
This endpoint returns a JSON response with the word of the day. The response also contains a word generated by a randomized seed value. See below for an example:
```json
{
    "word": "apple",
    "randomWord": "mouth"
}
```
